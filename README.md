### Summary
<!-- blog start -->

Most of my time on campus has been spent becoming a Computer Engineer and double majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently into debian linux, data structures, and working on old projects from college. I'm constantly working on mobile apps, updating my webpages or just plain rtfm! I use this repository for projects that I build in my courses and in my spare time. Please feel free to check out my most recent repositories!

### Latest Projects
